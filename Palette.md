Your palette is looking great â€” very nature-inspired with a mix of cool, grounded tones and a pop of freshness! Here's a quick breakdown and description of your colors, if youâ€™re planning to use them in a design system or share them:

### ðŸŽ¨ **Your Color Palette Overview**

| Color Name         | HEX       | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rich Black**     | `#111827` | A deep charcoal, ideal for high-contrast text      |
| **Delft Blue**     | `#213663` | Muted navy, good for headers or primary accents    |
| **Nyanza**         | `#e4fde1` | Very light minty green, great as a soft background |
| **Pistachio**      | `#8acb88` | Friendly green, good for highlights or CTAs        |
| **Hooker's Green** | `#648381` | Dusty teal/green, adds depth to UI or backgrounds  |

If you're building a **color system**, you could expand this palette with:

* **Tints (lighter versions)** of *Delft Blue* and *Hooker's Green* for backgrounds or hover states.
* **Shades (darker versions)** of *Pistachio* for buttons or borders.
* A **neutral tone** like a warm gray or beige for softer UIs, as a bridge between *Nyanza* and darker colors.

Would you like me to generate those tints/shades or help you build a Tailwind-compatible config using this palette?
